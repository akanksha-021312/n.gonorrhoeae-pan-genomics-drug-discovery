## Subtractive Proteomics: Identification of host non-homologous proteins


Essential proteins were screened against the Homo sapiens proteome using NCBI BLASTp.

Human proteome source:
- UniProt database

Thresholds:
- Bit score ≤ 100
- E-value < 1e-4
- Query coverage ≤ 35%
- Identity ≤ 35%

Proteins without significant similarity were retained as non-human homologs.
