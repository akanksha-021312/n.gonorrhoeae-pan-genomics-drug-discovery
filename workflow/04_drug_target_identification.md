## Novel Drug Target Identification

Non-human homologs were searched against DrugBank database using BLASTp.

Parameters:
- E-value < 1e-4

Proteins with similarity to known FDA-approved drug targets were shortlisted as novel targets. This step enables the identification of proteins with potential druggability.
